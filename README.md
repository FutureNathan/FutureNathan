### My name is Nathan Towianski and I'm attempting the world a much better place.

To do that I started [Amend](https://joinamend.com) with the idea that if we improve how to solve problem overall that we might be able to and more likely to make a big difference overall. I believe that every action or inaction is either making the world worse or better and I am hoping to come out net positive in a big way if I can.

Open, cooperative, decentralized, autonomous efforts for human good are my passion.

You can see some of my projects and learn more on my site [website](https://www.nathantowianski.com)

I'd love to work with or help anyone else also on a similar mission.
